hiera-file
==========

A data backend for Hiera that can return the content of whole files.

Travis Test status: [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/voxpupuli/hiera-file.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/voxpupuli/hiera-file)

Configuration
-------------

A sample Hiera config file that activates this backend and stores data in
/etc/puppet/data can be seen below:

    ---
    :backends:
      - file

    :hierarchy:
      - %{calling_module}
      - common

    :file:
      :datadir: /etc/puppet/data

Now, consider the following puppet module:

    mymodule
    |-- README
    |-- LICENSE
    `-- manifests
        `-- init.pp

Suppose that `init.pp` has the following content:

    class mymodule {
      notify { "example": message => hiera('giant_vampire_commandos'); }
    }

For the key "giant_vampire_commandos" as specified specified in the notify
resource declared in the `mymodule` module, Hiera will check the following two
locations for data:

    /etc/puppet/data/mymodule.d/giant_vampire_commandos
    /etc/puppet/data/common.d/giant_vampire_commandos

If either of those files exists, Hiera will read it and return the unedited
contents. A typical use for this might be file resources via the content
parameter. e.g.

    file { '/tmp/very_important_file':
      ensure  => file,
      owner   => 'root',
      group   => 'root',
      mode    => '0600',
      content => hiera('giant_vampire_commandos'),
    }

Interpolation
-------------

Since the file backend is built to deal with arbitrary chunks of data and
interpolation might not be meaningful and can break things, it can be disabled.
To disable it for the entire file backend, add the following to your hiera.yaml:

    ---
    # Your normal hiera.yaml
    :file:
      :interpolate: false # defaults to true


Installation
------------

### Via Rubygems (preferred)

    gem install hiera-file

### With Puppet/Pluginsync

Git clone this directory into your modulepath; Puppet will pluginsync lib/
onto all your nodes.
